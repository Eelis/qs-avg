As a case-study in machine-checked reasoning about the complexity of
algorithms in type theory, we describe a proof of the average-case
complexity of Quicksort in Coq.  The proof attempts to follow a
textbook development, at the heart of which lies a technical lemma
about the behaviour of the algorithm for which the original proof only
gives an intuitive justification.

We introduce a general framework for algorithmic complexity in type
theory, combining some existing and novel techniques: algorithms are
given a shallow embedding as monadically expressed functional
programs; we introduce a variety of operation-counting monads to
capture worst- and average-case complexity of deterministic and
non-deterministic programs, including the generalization to count in
an arbitrary monoid; and we give a small theory of expectation for
such non-deterministic computations, featuring both general map-fusion
like results, and specific counting arguments for computing bounds.

Our formalization of the average-case complexity of Quicksort includes
a fully formal treatment of the 'tricky' textbook lemma, exploiting
the generality of our monadic framework to support a key step in the
proof, where the expected comparison count is translated into the
expected length of a recorded list of all comparisons.
