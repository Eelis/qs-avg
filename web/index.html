    <h1>A Coq-Formalized Proof of Quicksort's Average-case Complexity</h1>

    <p>This page provides the Coq source files making up our formalization of a proof of the O(n log n) average-case complexity of Quicksort. This development is the subject of our submission for the TYPES 2008 post-proceedings, currently pending review, titled "A Machine-checked Proof of the Average-case Complexity of Quicksort in Coq".</p>

    <h2>Paper Abstract</h2>

    <p>As a case-study in machine-checked reasoning about the complexity of algorithms in type theory, we describe a proof of the average-case complexity of Quicksort in Coq.  The proof attempts to follow a textbook development, at the heart of which lies a technical lemma about the behaviour of the algorithm for which the original proof only gives an intuitive justification. Our formalization includes a fully formal treatment of this lemma, combining some existing and novel techniques: a shallow embedding of the algorithm as a monadically expressed functional program; a variety of operation-counting monads that capture worst- and average-case complexity of deterministic and non-deterministic programs, including the generalization to count in an arbitrary monoid; a small theory of expectation for such non-deterministic computations, featuring both general map-fusion like results, and specific counting arguments for computing bounds.</p>
